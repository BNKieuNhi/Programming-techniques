My task name is “Join 2 lists”. Given the two linked lists, headed by left and right, set the last linked of the left list to point to the right list, thus joining them into one list. Do not allocate any new nodes. I started the task from April 10th and finished the task on April 11th. It takes about 6 hours to complete this task. The operation of the algorithm consists of 4 steps. Firstly, create a first linked list and insert data into it. Secondly, create the second linked list and insert data in it. Third, start from the top node and find the last node of the first linked list by searching the NULL in the reference (next) of nodes. Finally, save the address of the top node of the second linked list to the reference (next) of the last node of the first linked list.
